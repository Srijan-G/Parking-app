# Parking-app
This is the prototype of an android app which lets the user book a parking slot in SRM university.
The user can select one of the different parking locations in SRM. 
The app will also genrate a qr code which the user can scan at the entrance of the parking itself as well when he exits.
This way the real entry and exit time of the parking can be recorded.
